## üî∞ Introduction

This project will contain functionality that uses entities from the [charm universe](https://charm.sh/) to define tui user interface components utilised by `snivilised` projects. In particular, it contains a `highway` control (custom charm bubble) that aims to provide a front end view of a worker pool, although there is nothing to say that this is it's only application.

### üéØ Highway

The highway contains multiple lanes representing different threads of execution, underpinned by a worker pool. As activity occurs, the corresponding lane in the highway updates to reflect completion of a job. However it is important to note that the highway, does not need to represent a worker pool, it can represent anything that can be visually represented by the concept of a group of lanes. The motivation for this control came from the need to be able to demonstrate the concurrent behaviour of [üåÄ agenor's](https://github.com/snivilised/agenor) navigator and the [üêú pants](https://github.com/snivilised/pants) worker pool that supports it.
